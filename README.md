# Typescript with React :blue_heart:

For this project I wanted to practice the basics of TS. I made a [Person component](src/components/Person.tsx) that gets passed down to [App.tsx](src/App.tsx). This is a very simple and small project but it's probably good to take a quick look at the JSX before looking through the rest of the code.
